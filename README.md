# ml_jup_notebooks

Note:
1. This is a repo to store all my machine learning (ML) jupyter notebooks. Each folder should be a totally independent project.
2. Each folder will have ether a requirements.txt (for pip) or a environmnet.yml (for conda), or other environment management files. In some sense, each folder is its own project.
3. Each folder will have a README file to help you with using the stuff in the folder.
