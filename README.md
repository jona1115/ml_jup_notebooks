# All My Machine Learning (ML) ü§ñ Jupyter Notebooks üìí

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**:
- This repo uses [Git LFS (Large File Storage)](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-git-large-file-storage). Before cloning, one will need to install LFS (see "cloning the repo" section)!

# üñ®Ô∏è Cloning the repo:
1. Install Git LFS, on Linux, run: `sudo apt install git-lfs` then `git lfs install`
2. Clone: `git clone git@github.com:jona1115/ml_jup_notebooks.git`
3. `cd ml_jup_notebooks`
4. Pull large files from GitHub LFS: `git lfs pull`

# Other Notes:
1. This is a repo to store all my machine learning (ML) Jupyter Notebooks. Each folder should be a totally independent project.
2. Each folder will have either a requirements.txt (for pip), or an environmnet.yml (for conda), or other environment management files. In some sense, each folder is its own project.
3. Each folder will have a README file to help you with using the stuff in the folder.
